              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>Fastly had a checkout process that was cumbersome and error-prone. I created a new experience that led
                to over 300 new paid accounts per month.</p>

          <h2>Customers couldn’t complete the checkout process</h2>
          <p>The checkout process was split between two pages. First, the user had to enter a tax address. Then they had
            to navigate to an entirely different page and enter their payment details. Finally, after they saved their
            details, they had to check a box to agree to terms and hit submit.<br><br>
            This led to hundreds of customers with payment information on file but not being billed simply because they
            never clicked submit.<br><br>
            The checkout process also did not comply with legal requirements and could have landed Fastly in legal
            trouble.</p>

          <h2>How we fixed the problems</h2>
          <p>We combined the tax address form and the payment information form to make it easier for the user to upgrade
            their account.<br><br>
            Improving the form validation made it impossible for users to get stuck in the state where their information
            was saved but was not being billed.<br><br>
            We also worked with legal to ensure we were disclosing the correct information.</p>

          <h2>Identifying the issue</h2>
          <p>During an audit of our account pages, I identified the checkout pages as an opportuinty for improvement. I jumped into Pendo to look for some key metrics. I also asked for SQL reports from my backend engineers to be run for data that's not in Pendo. <br><br>
          I found that 22% of customers failed to get through the upgrade process. I also found hundreds of customers who were stuck with payment information added but were not getting billed.</p>

          <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
          <p>Next, we looked to see what our competitors were doing. They all price and package their products
            differently so the results were varied.<br><br>
            However, we found a trend that most took a “Shopify-like” approach to the checkout process where you keep
            the entire flow on one screen.</p>

          <h2>Designing, testing, and aligning with stakeholders</h2>
          <p>The design was then tested internally with Fastly employees. We also leveraged usertesting.com and ran
            unmoderated usability tests.<br><br>
            Once people were able to find the upgrade page it was easy to complete the process. However, many users
            struggled to find where they needed to go to upgrade.<br><br>
            This was a key finding that informed future projects, but to keep the scope small, we decided to take that
            problem on as a next step.</p>
