              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <p>Fastly customers integrate with the CDN via a service. Two key steps to measure Fastly adoption are service creation and activation.<br><br>
              This project simplified the service creation process leading to over 5,000 new services being activated every month. That’s an increase of 78% over the old model.</p>

          <h2>Too many options led to few services being created</h2>
          <p>Fastly services have hundreds of configuration options. When a new service was created they were dropped onto the service configuration page with little instructions for how to set things up.
          This led to a service activation rate of around 39%. Fastly makes no money until a service is activated. Increasing activation rates is crucial to the business.</p>

          <h2>Focus the user on what is needed to do the job</h2>
          <p>I designed a new service creation page that exposes the crucial settings for a service. The team also added sensible default settings, to get the service running optimally.<br><br>
          Once the user has input their settings they can immediately activate the service.</p>

          <h2>Identifying the issue</h2>
          <p>We had several “voice of the customer” tickets in the backlog referencing how difficult it is to configure a service.<br><br>
          Out of the wide range of issues we found, the most common complaint was the service creation process.<br><br>
          We interviewed as many of the customers as we could from the tickets to see how they create and activate services. This helped us ensure we understood their pain points before diving into a solution.</p>

          <h2>Align the team on how to solve the problem prior to designing</h2>
          <p>I ran a workshop using the Big Idea Vignettes framework from IBM. Stakeholders from engineering, product management, and senior leadership participated.<br><br>
          This helped us come up with ideas for how we might solve the issue and get aligned on what’s most important. We also took some time to sketch out what a solution might look like before getting into the design.</p>

          <h2>Test assumptions with prototypes and research</h2>
          <p>Based on the ideas from the workshop, I created an initial design and prototype. I took that prototype to customers and Fastly employees in 1-on-1 interviews.<br><br>
          We found that the layout and workflow were good, but the language we used on the design was confusing and full of industry jargon.<br><br>
          I worked with our writers to come up with language that is easier to understand.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Increased service activation rate 78% YoY.</li>
            <li>Used by over 15,000 users every month.</li>
            <li>Over 4,500 new services are created every month using the new service creation page.</li>
            <li>The new page is mobile-friendly and can be completed from any device. Previously it could only be completed on desktop.</li>
